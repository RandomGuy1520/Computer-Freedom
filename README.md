# Computer-Freedom

This is only for computer class usages only.

All credit goes to my friend, who wrote the code, WangWei-CM.

This upload is just an exe file with some (maybe neccesary) dlls.

## Tutorial:

1. Block all system defenders, such as 360, Windows Defender, etc.

2. Place the dlls in C:\System32 or whatever place you should put it.

3. Run the exe.

4. Input "inputmode" and press Enter.

5. Input "2".

6. Input "procmgr".

7. Input "bat".

8. Input "add + <PID>" for all the wanted PIDs. (You can get them by entering the first char of the program name just after inputting "procmgr", or just "tasklist").

9. Then press "4".

10. You're done.
